# GoMockAPI
Mock APIs with ease 

GoMockAPI is a flexible API mocking tool built in Go that allows you to mock REST APIs for testing purposes. Users can configure multiple endpoints with various HTTP response codes and payloads. Additionally, responses can be dynamically triggered based on user-defined conditions, allowing for more complex and realistic test scenarios.


# Features
- Multiple configurable endpoints: Easily set up different routes with custom responses.
- Custom HTTP responses: Specify different HTTP codes (200, 404, 500, etc.) and payloads for each endpoint.
- Conditional responses: Trigger different responses based on conditions like request headers, query parameters, or request body content.
- Simulated delays: Add delays to simulate network latency and test client-side timeouts.
- Dynamic response generation: Use templates to generate dynamic responses using request data.
- Easy setup: Configure endpoints and responses using simple interface. Or upload postman json files.
- Lightweight: Minimal dependencies and simple to run.
- No external dependencies
- Inbuilt database.
